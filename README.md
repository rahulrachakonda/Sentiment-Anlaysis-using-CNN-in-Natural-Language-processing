# Sentiment-Anlaysis-using-CNN-in-Natural-Language-processing
 Implementing  a scalable and robust convolutional neural network for the problem of text-based movie review sentiment analysis.
 
 We will using the dataset provided from the movie review sentiment analysis on Kaggle.com. we will use techniques like tokenization,  stop words removal, format, padding, tuning neural network parameters.
 
 The dataset contain a comprised of tab-separated files with phrases from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. Each phrase has a PhraseId. Each sentence has a  SentenceId. Phrases that are repeated again (such as short/common words) are only included once in the data.
Following are the sentiment labels:
•	0 - negative
•	1 - somewhat negative
•	2 - neutral
